# CS-698S

Bayesian Machine Learning course at IIT Kanpur.

<b>Year</b> - 2017

<b>Semester</b> - Winter(Jan-May)

<b>Professor</b> - Piyush Rai

<b>Project Description</b> : 

Theoretical examination and implementation of the concepts in online variational
Bayesian inference, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) and Mean-Field
variational inference on real world data and models such as Poisson Matrix Factorization and Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA).

Also gained hands on experience in Edward, a software for probabilistic modelling and inference that is built on Tensorflow.

The project was done in association with <a href="https://github.com/kush2197"> Kushal Kumar</a> , Y14 batch IIT Kanpur.
